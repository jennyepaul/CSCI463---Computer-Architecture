# CSCI463---Computer-Architecture
This repository contains a simulation of an RV32I computer for my Computer Architecture class at NIU, FALL 2020.

This project was split over a few assignments, starting by creating the memory dump for the output, then slowly
adding functionality until it created a single thread, RV32I simulator.
